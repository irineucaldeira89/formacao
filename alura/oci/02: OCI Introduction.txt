OCI Overview

Some of world's largest enterprises are running their mission critical workloads on articles next generation cloud platform called Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. 
Today, I'm really excited to tell you more about it. In this lesson, you will see a general overview of what you can do in OCI.

Let's get started. To keep things simple, let us break them down into seven major categories: cloud infrastructure, database services, data and AI, 
analytics, governance and administration, developer services, and application services.

But first, the foundation of any cloud platform is the global footprint of regions. We have many generally available regions in the world, along with multi-cloud 
support with Microsoft Azure and a differentiated hybrid offering called Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer.
